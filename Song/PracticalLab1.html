			Could dress up</br>
			To get love </br>
			But guess what?</br>
			I'm never gonna be that girl</br>
			Who's living in a Barbie world</br>

			Could wake up</br>
			And make up</br>
			And play dumb</br>
			Pretending that I need a boy</br>
			Who's gonna treat me like a toy</br>

			I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things</br>
			Like diamond rings</br>
			But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string</br>
			This queen don't need a king</br>
			
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		<strong> [Chorus]</strong></br>
		Oh, I don't know what you've been told</br>
		But this gal right here's gonna rule the world</br>
		Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be</br>
		No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty</br>
		You get off on your nine to five</br>
		Dream of picket fences and trophy wives</br>
		But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be</br>
		No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		Mister Right could be nice for one night</br>
		But then he wanna take control</br>
		And I would rather fly solo</br>

		Then Snow White</br>
		She did it right</br>
		In her life</br>
		Had seven men to do the chores</br>
		'Cause that's not what a lady's for</br>
		The only thing a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity</br>
		And I might love me some vanilla but I'm not that sugar sweet</br>
		Call me HBIC</br>

	<p>&nbsp </p>
		<strong> [Chorus]</strong></br>
		Oh, I don't know what you've been told</br>
		But this gal right here's gonna rule the world</br>
		Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be, because I wanna be</br>
		No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty</br>
		You get off on your nine to five</br>
		Dream of picket fences and trophy wives</br>
		But no, I'm never gonna be, 'cause I don't wanna be</br>
		No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		Sure, I'm a pretty girl</br>
		Up in a pretty world</br>
		But they say pretty hurts</br>
		And I don't wanna sit still</br>
		I'm a pretty girl</br>
		Up in a pretty world</br>
		But no, I won't sit still, look pretty</br>

		Sure, I'm a pretty girl</br>
		Up in a pretty world</br>
		But they say pretty hurts</br>
		And I don't wanna sit still</br>
		I'm a pretty girl</br>
		Up in a pretty world</br>
		But no, I won't sit still, look pretty</br>

	<h1 id="specialdin"> Scars to your beautiful</h1> 
	<p> <b>Alessia Cara</b> </p> 
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		She just wants to be beautiful</br>
		She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits</br>
		She craves attention, she praises an image</br>
		She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor</br>
		Oh, she don't see the light that's shining</br>
		Deeper than the eyes can find it</br>
		Maybe we have made her blind</br>
		So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away</br>
		'Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		<strong> [Chorus]</strong></br>
		But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark</br>
		You should know you're beautiful just the way you are</br>
		And you don't have to change a thing,</br> the world could change its heart</br>
		No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful</br>
		Oh-oh, oh-oh</br>
		And you don't have to change a thing,</br> the world could change its heart</br>
		No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful</br>
	<p> &nbsp </p>
		She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving</br>
		You know, covergirls eat nothing</br>
		She says beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything</br>
		What's a little bit of hunger?</br>
		I could go a little while longer, she fades away</br>
		She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it</br>
		Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface</br>
		Oh, oh</br>
		So to all the girls that's hurting</br>
		Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer</br>
		The light that shines within</br>
	<p> &nbsp </p>
		<strong> [Chorus]</strong></br>
		There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark</br>
		You should know you're beautiful just the way you are</br>
		And you don't have to change a thing, </br>the world could change its heart</br>
		No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful</br>

		Oh-oh, oh-oh</br>
		And you don't have to change a thing, </br>the world could change its heart</br>
		No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful</br>
	<p> &nbsp </p>
		No better you than the you that you are </br>(no better you than the you that you are)</br>
		No better life than the life we're living </br>(no better life than the life we're living)</br>
		No better time for your shine, you're a star </br>(no better time for your shine, you're a star)</br>
		Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful</br>
	<p> &nbsp </p>
		<strong> [Chorus]</strong></br>
		And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark</br>
		You should know you're beautiful just the way you are</br>
		And you don't have to change a thing, </br>the world could change its heart</br>
		No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful</br>
		Oh-oh, oh-oh</br>
		And you don't have to change a thing, </br>the world could change its heart</br>
		No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful</br>

		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
<p>&nbsp </p>
		My daddy says that life comes at you fast</br>
		We all like blades of grass</br>
		We come to prime and in time we just wither away</br>
		And it all changes</br>
		My view with a looking glass won't catch the past</br>
		Only photographs remind us of the passing of days</br>
		Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears</br>
		See I recall being afraid of the dark</br>
		And holding on to teddy bears</br>
		I'd wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears</br>
		That was then and now I'm here</br>
		And the night is mine</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		<strong> [Chorus]</strong></br>
		So hear me scream</br>
		I was too young to understand what it means</br>
		I couldn't wait til I could be seventeen</br>
		I thought he lied when he said take my time to dream</br>
		Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		I'm Seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		Seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		Seventeen</br>
		Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		My mother said don't forget where you come from, where you've been</br>
		Always keep your closest friends they can't slip away</br>
		They keep you grounded</br>
		Oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice</br>
		And yeah I guess that sounded nice when I was ten</br>
		Oh but never were there truer words</br>
		In all my days I've ever heard</br>
		And when she told me little girl the answer is love</br>
		So those are words that I keep with me</br>
		Though the seasons change so quickly</br>
		Keep them buried in my heart</br>
		And never fought</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		<strong> [Chorus]</strong></br>
		So hear me scream</br>
		I was too young to understand what it means</br>
		I couldn't wait til I could be seventeen</br>
		I thought she lied when she said "take my time to breathe"</br>
		Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		I'm Seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		Seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		Seventeen</br>
		Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		I been goin on, I been growin up</br>
		I'm a know it all, I don't know enough</br>
		See I was racing and waiting for the day that I would be old enough</br>
		Guess I'll be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough</br>
	<p>&nbsp </p>
		I was too young to understand what it means</br>
		I couldn't wait til I could be seventeen</br>
		I thought she lied when she said "take my time to breathe"</br>
		Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		I'm Seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		Seventeen</br>
		Ohh oh oh oh oh oh</br>
		Oh oh oh oh</br>
		Seventeen</br>
		Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen </br>
